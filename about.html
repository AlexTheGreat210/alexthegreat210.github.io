<h1>Hello World</h1>
<h2>My name is Alex and I am learning how to code.</h2>
<h3>So far I've done allot of stuff on FreeCodeCamp (Nice place to learn) and I have made this little website to show off what I've learned!
I got into coding when I was in 9th grade, but I failed and was kicked out of the program :(. Just recently I was redirected into the path of coding and I'm glad I was.
I've been working with a tutor from "Codeup" and it's an awesome place. Other then that I always loved to code but never had enough support to get into it and make something out of it.
But now that I'm getting tought how to do it I'm love it! I'm glad I did it, and I hope to make a career out of doing this and hopefully one day help someone else get into coding and they get a career out of it.
So after all that I've been tought I'm able to write you this and show off some of the skills that I have gained.</h3>
<h4>I have a few links to not only my presidency campaign but to my twicth and youtube! </h4>
<h5>Make sure to check those out!</h5>
<p>Here is a list of some of my favorite things</p>

  <li>And coding</li>
